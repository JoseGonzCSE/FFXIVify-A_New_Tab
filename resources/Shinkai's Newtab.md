- Byousoku 5 Centimeter (5cm/s)
- Kotonoha no Niwa (Garden of Words)

The project is free and open-sourced, you can check it out [here](https://suitangi.github.io/Minimal-Newtab/). I don't collect any user data nor profit; this extension does need to be online to work though (to load the backgrounds, as it does not download them).
